## Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize key trends and metrics within the Kaggle community. By examining datasets, competitions, and author contributions, we aim to provide insights into the growth and impact of data science activities on the platform.

## Problem Statement:

- The Kaggle platform hosts a vast array of datasets and competitions, providing valuable resources for data scientists and researchers. However, with over 9,400 datasets and 5,118 competitions, users often struggle to identify the most relevant and high-quality datasets for their specific needs. Additionally, the distribution of datasets across various categories and the varying sizes of these datasets add to the complexity of selection.

- To develop an intelligent recommendation system that leverages the available metadata (such as category, size, and ratings) to help users efficiently discover and select the most suitable datasets for their projects. This system should also provide insights into trends and popular categories to guide users in their data exploration and analysis.

## Methodology:

### 1. Data Collection
Gather all relevant datasets from various sources to ensure comprehensive coverage of the analysis.

### 2. Data Preparation
Cleanse and prepare the data by:
- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values

This ensures the accuracy and reliability of your analysis.

### 3. Modeling
Create relationships between data tables to enable:
- Cross-filtering
- Complex analyses

This step is critical for creating a robust and interconnected data model.

### 4. Dashboard Design
Plan the dashboard layout by:
- Deciding which visualizations best represent the data insights
- Ensuring that the dashboard is intuitive and user-friendly

### 5. Visualization Creation
Create the following visualizations to represent the data insights:
- **Bar Charts**: For trends and comparisons
- **Line Graphs**: For changes over time
- **Numerical Indicators**: For key metrics

### 6. Filter Implementation
Add filters to allow users to customize their view based on:
- Year
- Month
- Category
- Size type
- File type

### 7. Testing & Iteration
Test the dashboard’s functionality to ensure it works as intended. Iterate based on user feedback to enhance usability and accuracy.

### 8. Deployment & Sharing
Publish the dashboard to the Power BI service, making it accessible to the intended audience.

### 9. Maintenance & Updates
Regularly update the dataset and make necessary adjustments to visualizations to keep the dashboard up-to-date and relevant.

## Key Insights
### Total Datasets
- **9,400** datasets are available on Kaggle.

### Yearly Trends
- Dataset submissions peaked in **2017** and **2020**.

### Average Files
- Each dataset has an average of **5.485** files.

### Top Categories
- The **COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)** has the highest visibility with **5,490 views**.

## Project Expected Outcomes

Based on the Kaggle dashboard image, here are some expected outcomes for your project:

### Increased Dataset Contributions
- Aim to increase the number of datasets contributed to the platform, following the upward trend shown in the “Yearly Trend of Dataset” chart.

### Diverse Category Representation
- Ensure a balanced distribution of datasets across various categories like **Film**, **Economics**, and **Biology**, as depicted in the pie chart.

### High-Quality Datasets
- Focus on creating highly rated datasets, similar to the top-rated ones listed, such as **Pneumonia** and **COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)**.

### Community Engagement
- Encourage more authors to participate and contribute, increasing the total number of authors and fostering a collaborative environment.

## Conclusion

The Kaggle dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of data trends and contributions within the Kaggle community. By visualizing key metrics such as the total number of datasets, average files per dataset, and the distribution of datasets by size, this dashboard offers valuable insights into the growth and collaborative efforts of data scientists worldwide. 

The yearly trend analysis and categorization of datasets further enhance our understanding of the evolving landscape of data sharing. This project not only highlights the significance of data-driven insights but also underscores the importance of community engagement in advancing the field of data science.
